# FEATURES

This folder is for feature specs that are easy for humans and AI to use.

## Workflow

1. Create a feature spec (copy `feature-template.md`).
2. Keep it decision-complete (scope, acceptance criteria, edge cases).
3. After shipping, add a short \"Result\" section and link PR/commit.

## Naming

- `YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name.md` for time-based ordering, or
- `feature-name.md` for stable features.
