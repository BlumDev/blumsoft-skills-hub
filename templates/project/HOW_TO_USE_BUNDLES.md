# How To Use Bundles

## Default Rule

Start with the bundle core skills only. Add extended skills only when complexity demands it.

## Quick Picks

- `project-kickoff`: new project or taking over an unfamiliar repo
- `web-wizard`: UI/UX/SEO landing pages and web features
- `security-engineer`: audits and hardening before release
- `data-ai`: prompt/RAG/agent systems
- `devops-cloud`: deployment and reliability

## Best Practice Prompts

- \"Use `<bundle-id>` core only. List assumptions, then propose a plan, then execute.\"
