# Copilot Instructions

Use the skills in `.github/skills/` as the primary guidance.

Default workflow:
1. Pick one bundle (start with core skills only).
2. Follow the plan/verify gates from `essentials`.
3. Keep changes minimal and production-focused.

If this is a new project, start with `project-kickoff`.
