# Bundle: Project Kickoff

Compose with: `essentials`

Start with core skills:
- `project-bootstrap`
- `project-development`
- `tool-design`
- `docu`

Workflow:
1. Capture `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` (goal, users, constraints, success metrics).
2. Decide minimal architecture and first vertical slice.
3. Create initial `FEATURES/` specs + `DECISIONS.md`.
4. Produce milestone plan + verification gates.

Starter prompt:
Use the `Project Kickoff` bundle. Keep it minimal and decision-complete.
