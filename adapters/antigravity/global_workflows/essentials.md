# Bundle: Essentials

Start with core skills:
- `brainstorming`
- `writing-plans`
- `systematic-debugging`
- `verification-before-completion`
- `requesting-code-review`

Workflow:
1. Clarify goal and constraints.
2. Write execution plan.
3. Implement and debug systematically.
4. Verify before completion.

Starter prompt:
Use the `Essentials` bundle and core skills only unless I explicitly request extended skills.
