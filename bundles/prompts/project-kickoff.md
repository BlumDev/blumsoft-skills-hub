Use the `Project Kickoff` bundle.

Start with core skills:
- `project-bootstrap`
- `project-development`
- `tool-design`
- `docu`

Process:
1. Define scope, success metrics, and constraints.
2. Choose minimal architecture that can ship.
3. Define the first vertical slice (end-to-end).
4. Create/update project docs (`PROJECT_CONTEXT.md`, `DECISIONS.md`, `FEATURES/`).
5. Produce a milestone plan with verification gates.
